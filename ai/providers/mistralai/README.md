## Model Versions

For maximum flexibility, we provide both **Latest** and **Dated** versions of each model:

### ðŸ”„ **Latest Versions** (Recommended)
- **Format**: `model-name-latest` (e.g., `mistral-large-latest`)
- **Behavior**: Automatically points to the most recent version
- **Use Case**: Development, testing, and applications that benefit from automatic updates
- **Advantage**: Always get the latest improvements and features

### ðŸ“… **Dated Versions** (Stable)
- **Format**: `model-name-YYMM` (e.g., `mistral-large-2411`)
- **Behavior**: Fixed to a specific model version
- **Use Case**: Production environments requiring reproducible results
- **Advantage**: Guaranteed consistency and predictable behavior

### ðŸ’¡ **Which Version to Choose?**
- **Use Latest** for: Development, experimentation, staying current with improvements
- **Use Dated** for: Production deployments, research requiring reproducibility, compliance requirements

### ðŸŽ¯ **Model Configuration**

Magistral models are designed for step-by-step problem solving and analytical tasks.

### ðŸ”§ **Reasoning Mode Parameter**

Magistral models support a **`reasoning_mode`** boolean parameter that controls how the model processes requests:

- **`reasoning_mode: true`** (Default): Enables reasoning mode with system prompt for step-by-step problem solving
- **`reasoning_mode: false`**: Disables reasoning mode for standard chat behavior without system prompt

This parameter is automatically transformed to the Mistral AI API `prompt_mode` parameter (`"reasoning"` or `null`) based on your selection.


# Configure
After installation, you need to get API keys from [MistralAI](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/) and setup in Settings -> Model Provider.
